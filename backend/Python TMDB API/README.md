# Search and add movie to database
I wrote a Python script to do a query search of TMDB's database of 950,000+ movies, allowing the user to dynamically search and select which movie to add to the website's database. 

Once this "request movie" feature is added into the website, it will allow the community to continuously add their favourite movies and thus create a more representative and diverse database.
