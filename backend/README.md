# Full Stack Development with Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB â€“ Full Course

## Overview
This course is taught [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ&list=PLJLf67YAhhod0OMooE_QOYcU_D63d26_p&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by the amazing people at freeCodeCamp.

In this course, I will learn how to create a full stack application using **MongoDB** for the database, **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **React** for the front end.

## Parts
This course is split up into 2 parts.

## Part 1:
**Farhan Hasin Chaudry** will teach the **back end**

### Notes:
- I installed IntelliJ IDEA, as it is the industry standard Java IDE

\
**Database Setup**
- **MongoDB Atlas** is a platform from MongoDB themselves that allows you to spin up MongoDB servers on the cloud
    - *My database information:*
        - Username: adonojha
        - Password: dqdc3uKZAlkRcT7e
    - Need to use a database *client* to connect to this database (I will be using MongoDB Compass, a GUI for working with databases)

\
**API Setup Using Spring Boot**
- Initialized at [start.spring.io](start.spring.io)
- Using build automation tool **Maven**
- Spring Boot version 3.1.7

\
**API Information:**

\
**Database Configuration in IntelliJ** \
The next step is to configure the database so we can connect to the MongoDB cluster we had previously set up and communicate with it.

## Part 2:
**Gavin Lon** will teach the **front end**

### Notes: 

**Tools used for front end**:
- Node.js
- ReactJS
- Axios
- Bootstrap
