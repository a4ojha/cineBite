# cineBite

## Overview
I am combining my love for movies and coding to build a full-stack project using **MongoDB** for the database, **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **React** for the front end.

ðŸš€ This project is now deployed! Visit [here](https://cinebite.adonojha.com)

## Recent updates
Currently implementing feature to search a larger movie database to add to cineBite's database. See more [here](https://github.com/a4ojha/cineBite/tree/main/backend/Python%20TMDB%20API)
